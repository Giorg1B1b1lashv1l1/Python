#Data Types
#Each value in python has a type
print("Hello World")#is str(string) type because the text is in quotes
print(2024)#is int(integer) type because it's number,whole numbers are called integers
print(6/2)#dividing two integers produces a decimal,which is called a float-3.0
print(7.3 * 5)#you can perform mathematical operations with floats,just like with integers
