#Welcome to Python!
#Python is a popular programing language,it was craeted by Guido Van Rossum,and released in 1991.
#Python is used for:
    #~ web development(server-side)
    #~ game development
    #~ software development
    #~ mathematics
    #~ system scripting
#let's get started

#Python has a simply syntax,which means you'll be able to learn it quickly an put to use after just a few secend.

print(2024)#easy syntax
      #int
# The print command is the easiest way to send a specified message to the screen or other display device

print("Hello world")
          #str
#when printing text outputs,you need to enclose the text(str) in either single('') or double("") quotes

print("Shopping List:")
print("bread")
print("egss")
#There are situations where you might want to print muliyple messages in your code.
#Each print statments outputs text in a new line
 

#Simple Operations
print(2+2)
print(5+4-3)
#Doing a calculation in Python is simple,just enter it into the print statment



#we also can do multiplications in Python,and we should use asterisk symbol (*)
print(15*18)


#Now let's do the division,we should use a slash
print(50/5)


# Just like in regular math,we can use parenthese to indicate the operations we want performed first,
#Like this:
print(2*(3+4))

#Python also can perform operations with really big numbers
print(13579*2468)
