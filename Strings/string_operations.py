#String Operations
#Concatenation
#In python math works with words as well as numbers.
#so not only can we add integers and floats,but also strings,using something called concatenation,which can be done on any two strings.like this:
print("spam"+"eggs")

print("2"+"2")#will be "22" because it's string

#you may not be able to add strings to integers,but you can multiply by them!
#Multiplying a string by an integer,produces a repeated version of the original string.Like this:
print("spam"*3)
print(4*"2")
