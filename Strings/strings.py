#Strings
#We can create string by entering text between two single or double quotation marks.Like this:
print("Python is fun")
print('Python is fun')
#they are same
#Everything in quotes is a string,even numbers.
print("2024")#is string because it is in quotes

print('Brian\'s mother: he\'s not angel.he\'s very naughty boy')#if you want to include a quote in a string,you need to escape it using a backslash
