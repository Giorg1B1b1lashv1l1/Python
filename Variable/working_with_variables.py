# Working With Variables

#So,you've got your variable and named it.you are now free to use them to perform corresponding operations,just as you do with numbers and strings.
#LIKE THIS:
x=12
print(x)

print(x+4)
print(x*2)
print(x//5)

#Need to change the value of a variable?Easy.Variable can be reassigned as many times as you want.LIKE THIS:
x=321.654
print(x)

x="This is a string"
print(x+"!")

#But this is not a good practice

#A program can include multiple variables.which can be used together to produce a result.
#For examples
a=8
name="Gio"
print(a*name)

#You can use the del statement to remove a variable
x=50
del x
