#Variables
#A variable lets you store a value by assigning it to a name.The name can be used to refer to the value later in the program


#To assign a variable,use aone equal sign.
user="Giorgi"

#The equal sign is called the assigment operator and used to assign a value to a variable.
#You can assign any type of value to your variable
x=88
y="Hello"
z=7.4


#Naming your variables is pretty flexible.you can use letters,numbers,and underscores in  variable names.But you can't use special symbols,or start the name with a number. 
#Remember,python is a case sensitive language.which means "L"astname and "l"astname are two different variable names
